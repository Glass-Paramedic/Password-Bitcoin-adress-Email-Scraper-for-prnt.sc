# Password-Bitcoin-Email-Scraper-for-prnt.sc
Scrapes potential passwords from https://prnt.sc

Uses Tesseract OCR to pick up keywords.
Barebones but funtional. 

## Idea for what you could add:

- regex bitcoin/email adress detection
- Multithreading for faster scraping
- Proxies to prevent ratelimiting (Currently without mutlithreading the scraper does not get ratelimited)
- Saving text instead of images
